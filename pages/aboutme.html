    <p>Hi, I am Mc Kennedy Gomez, 
    an <abbr title="Information Technology">IT</abbr> student from <abbr title="Technological University of the Philippines">TUP</abbr> Manila at your service. 
    Welcome to my personal portfolio that I built using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML" target="_blank">HTML</a>. As you can see, this is a very basic 
    site that we students build to learn the basics and fundamentals of creating proper webpages that we can share to the internet. As of the moment, this site's content 
    and appearance is a bit lackluster since this is my very first project in creating a website. But hopefully with time and expertise from our 
    professors, we develop and discover new skills to submit a full-fledged website. </p>

    <p>My name is Mc Kennedy Gomez, and I'm a TUP Manila student studying information technology. Welcome to my HTML-based personal 
    website portfolio. As you can see, this is a very simple website that we created as students to learn the foundations of building
    good websites that we can share online. Since this is my first attempt at constructing a website, the information and aesthetic of 
    the site are still rather lacking. But maybe as we gain experience and learn new abilities from our lecturers, we will be able to create 
    a complete website. </p>

    <p>My goals as of the moment is to complete my current projects while maximizing resources to learn HTML and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS" target="_blank">CSS</a> 
    for web development. This is a great challenge since coding is not really something I am very enthusiastic about. I have more interest in other fields of technology but I 
    am grateful that I am learning this field of technology. With the help of my college professors and fellow classmates, I know I will be able to surpass the roadblocks that 
    I am facing for my future career.</p>

    <p>My current objectives are to finish my existing tasks and make the most of my resources to study HTML and CSS for web development. 
    Given that I don't really enjoy coding, this is a fantastic challenge for me. Although I am pleased that I am studying this sector of technology, 
    I am more interested in other areas of technology. I am confident that with the support of my college teachers and classmates, 
    I will be able to get through the obstacles in the way of my future profession.</p>
